What is This
==============================================================================
``zelfred`` is a framework for building interactive applications similar to `Alfred Workflow <https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/>`_, but in Python and for the terminal. It is free, open source, and cross-platform.

You can view sample applications in the `app Gallery <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/zelfred-project/blob/main/app_gallery/README.rst>`_.
